				<h2>What I've been up to lately</h2>
				<p>I'm currently self-employed working with forward-thinking companies to improve their digital products through data-driven optimization. The work I'm doing is focused on growth in both strategy and execution: optimizing sales, leads and experiences through evidence-based experimentation. If you think we might be a good match in working together please don't hesitate to reach right on out: <span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override; direction: rtl;">moc.liamg@nolnahmot</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="additional">
				<h2>Other work stuff</h2> 
				<p>I've been working in digital for over a dozen years and the optimization space for more than five. I have direct, hands-on experience with not only a/b testing strategy but also third-party JavaScript, HTML and CSS development.</p> 
				<p>Prior to striking it out on my own, I worked as the Director of eCommerce Growth for a local startup called <a href="https://www.everlywell.com" target="_blank">Everlywell</a>. You might recognize the company from ABC's <a href="https://abc.com/shows/shark-tank" target="_blank"><i>Shark Tank</i></a>. It has been the second-most successful <i>Shark Tank</i> company.</i></p> </p>
				<p>Before Everlywell I worked in a/b testing strategy and execution with a very high-volume e-commerce company in the home-furnishings space.</p>
				<p>Before that I worked for an agency called <a href="http://clearhead.me" target="_blank">Clearhead</a> which was later acquired by <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/interactive-index" target="_blank">Accenture Interactive</a> where I helped big brands grow through the use of multivariate &amp; a/b testing, personalization and analytics. At Clearhead I started as an a/b test developer and later worked as an Optimization Director leading product strategy for AT&T Customer Service, Synchrony Financial, The Art Institutes and Vitamix.</p>
				<p>Before working at Clearhead, I worked for <a href="https://www.pwc.com" target="_blank">PwC</a> where I focused on growth/business development efforts for consulting projects in the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industry/tice.html" target="_blank">technology, media and telecom</a> sectors.</p>
				<p>Prior to that, I got my start at <a href="http://www.digital-day.com" target="_blank">Digital Day</a>, an online marketing agency where I cut my teeth on SEO, copywriting, email marketing, social media and PPC advertising for consumer packaged goods brands.

				<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
				<p>I love learning, and on top of a bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://www.udayton.edu/" target="_blank">University of Dayton</a>, I've taken copywriting, design and UX courses at the NYC campus of <a href="http://www.miamiadschool.com/advertising-school/new-york" target="_blank">Miami Ad School</a> and classes on web technlogies from what is now <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>. As of January 2020 I'm currently taking a course on "Vanilla" JavaScript to keep my skills current. I've also been trying to learn Spanish to some degree of success.</pÃŸ>
