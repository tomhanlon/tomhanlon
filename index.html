				<h2>Before last October, I had never held a chicken in my life</h2>
				<p>It wasn't one of those bucket list things that people do, like traveling to every state in an RV or walking along the Great Wall of China.
				</p>
				<p>I was on a friend's farm in southern Ohio and my friend asked me if I wanted to hold a chicken. Before I knew it I had a chicken in my arms.</p>
				<p>
				If you've never held a chicken before, you're never really ready for it. Suddenly, the chicken is in your arms and you think, "okay, this really isn't bad."</p>
				<p> I'd like to think this is a metaphor for life but maybe it's just about holding chickens.</p>

				<h2>Work Stuff</h2>
				<p>I work for an agency called <a href="http://clearhead.me" target="_blank">Clearhead</a>, where I help big brands grow through the use of multivariate &amp; a/b testing, personalization and analytics.</p>
				<p>Before working for Clearhead, I worked for <a href="https://www.pwc.com" target="_blank">PwC</a>, where I focused on growth/business development efforts for consulting projects in the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industry/tice.html" target="_blank">technology, information, communication and entertainment</a> space.</p>
				<p>Prior to that, I worked for an <a href="http://www.digital-day.com" target="_blank">online marketing agency</a> where I got my start in SEO, copywriting, email marketing, social media and PPC advertising for consumer packaged goods companies.

				<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
				<p>I love learning, and on top of a bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://www.udayton.edu/" target="_blank">University of Dayton</a>, I've taken copywriting, design and UX courses at the NYC campus of <a href="http://www.miamiadschool.com/advertising-school/new-york" target="_blank">Miami Ad School</a> and classes on web technlogies from what is now <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>.</p>
				<p>I should probably mention that I have a <a href="https://www.tomhanlon.blog" target="_blank">blog</a> that I've neglected for a very long time.</p>
